In the world of inbound, businesses are visualized as flywheels instead of funnels. A flywheel is a model adapted by HubSpot to explain the momentum you gain when you align your entire organization around delivering a remarkable customer experience. You can increase that growth by adding force to the flywheel or by removing friction from it. Sales organizations in general have no problem using force. If you want to help your sales team grow better, you need to find ways to remove friction. Learn how to use the frictionless selling framework so that your team can spend more time selling. Also, discover how to align your team with your target buyer and how to transform your team through a culture of learning.
